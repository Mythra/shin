# Shin #

Shin is a collection of tools I've built for collecting information related
to the game Phasmophobia. These tools are not built for any sort of Piracy, or
Cheating reasons; I also want to say here ***NEVER USE THIS WORK FOR THOSE
PURPOSES.*** If you ruin it, it doesn't just ruin it for you, but all of us.

Most tools will have varying levels of documentation, I will do my best to make
them user friendly. That being said I can't make any promises are these are
incredibly spare time projects.

## Quality Notes ##

***This code is very much not considered quality, and is basically held
together by duck tape, and a prayer. There are many things that could be
done better. Unfortunately, most of this code is written as a "oh crap a
build got pushed at 2am and broke everything lemme fix everything." style
and i have other side projects that demand my quality time.***

That being said, I'll happily accept all PR's related to quality as I'd love
for this to be quality, but I just don't have the time for these tools.
